                    <p>A High Risk AI-System refers to AI applications that can significantly impact individuals or society, especially if they handle sensitive data or perform critical tasks. These systems may be used in areas like law enforcement, healthcare, education, or social services, where errors or misuse could have serious consequences. High risk means there is a greater potential for harm or violation of rights, so these systems are subject to stricter rules and regulations to ensure they are used safely and ethically.</p>

                    <p>A Low Risk AI-System is one that poses minimal potential for harm or negative impact on individuals or society. These systems are usually used in less sensitive areas, where their outcomes are unlikely to cause significant disruption or risk to peopleâ€™s rights and well-being. While they still need to follow legal guidelines, they face fewer regulatory restrictions compared to high-risk systems, due to the lower chance of causing harm.</p>
